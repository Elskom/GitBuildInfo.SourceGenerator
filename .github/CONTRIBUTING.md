# Contributing

1. Before you open an issue read the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first.
This details what the expected behavior should be.

2. Ensure the issue or pull request was not already suggested.
However if the pull request needed reopened due to some issues in it it would be detailed.

3. A pull request should not be opened until a issue is tracked on the issues tab.
After that the pull request should reference the issue and when merge should automatically close it.

4. This file could change at any time so be sure to read this every time you open a issue or pull request to stay up to date.
